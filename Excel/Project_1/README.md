This project analyses the number of orders per consumer. In each sheet, I analyzed whether the customer returned the product, and how changed the sum of sales and amount of purchased items with the use of pivot tables and charts. Additionally, at the end with the use of statistical tests such as the Student's Test, I summarized the data and presented the results.
