In each sheet of Excel projects, I presented different kinds of analysis (for instance cumulative averages, averages, and sums). With the usage of Pivot Tables, and Statistical Tests (such as ANOVA or T Studentâ€™s Test) I summarised the data and presented the result with charts and tables. 

In PowerBi I focused on replacing values from original data, creating new columns with DAX, formulating measurements, and later using them in visualization. I summarised the data with the usage of clustered bar charts, scatter charts, or slicer. Additionally, I used tools such as grouping by legend or summing values from chosen data.

In Tableau projects I analyzed and cleaned data using measurements, calculations, and filters, later I visualized charts with the basics of analytics (distributions, averages, boxplots, and references line/bands). In the end, also I used Dashboards to better present my visualizations to the public.
